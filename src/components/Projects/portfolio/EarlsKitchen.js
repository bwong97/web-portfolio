      <p>[Sept 2019 - Dec 2019] Led a team of BCIT students to develop a proof-of-concept internal tool for Earls management with the
intent of improving their workflow of modifying their menus across their restaurants. We developed the
application using the Flask framework in Python, and practiced Agile methodologies in addition to a
Trello board. By the end of the semester we had a working baseline model that would demonstrate the
main functions that they would normally perform using a spreadsheet but more streamlined.</p>
